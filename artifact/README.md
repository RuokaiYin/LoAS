# LoAS -- Artifact Evaluation for MICRO 2024

### This sub-directory is created to simplify the artifact evaluation process for the reviewers.

### Results to be reproduced: 
Table.II and Figure.11 in the paper.

### How to use?
To reproduce each result, simply go inside the sub-sub-direcotry with the name of the result-label. Inside each sub-sub-direcotry, there is an automatic script (``run.sh``) for easing the result reproducing process.

Please follow the ``README.md`` inside each sub-sub-directory for more information.

### Acknowledgement
We thank for the reviewers for their efforts to evaluate the artifact!
